# ANDROIDHtmlOhmsLaw
Android HTML Wrapper around Ohmâ€™s Law Java Script
This is a very basic Android wrapper that hosts a simple HTML Java Script JQuery Mobile app that does Ohm's Law computations.
It is about the extent of my experience using this technique, as I did it to just try it out.
Not the funnest way to build an app in my opinion, but if the requirements fit this approach then it would be appropriate.
The DOM has enough capability to build a basic app, but building an extremely complicated app and trying to debug it in the browser 
would seem a bit cumbersome to me.
